# Collect-Rental-Information
This project is centered around data scraping to gather rental information from diverse platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, and Zillow. The aim is to extract pertinent data including rental prices, property particulars, and contact details, followed by uploading the acquired data to the database.

A range of techniques and tools has been utilized to scrape data from source websites. Although the complete project repository is not accessible, if you have any particular queries or require further information about the project, please don't hesitate to connect with me on LinkedIn.
